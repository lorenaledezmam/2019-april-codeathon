#chal-alu-lea

Diagnosis:
-USB is using FlipCause as their payment platform.
-USB is using Servage one for their Wordpress hosting 
- AlumnUSB uses WordPress as their platform.
- Summary of campaigns
1. Iluminemos la USB
2. Premio a la Labor Docente AlumnUSB
3. Beca a un Estudiante de la USB
4. Dona un Monto a la Biblioteca de la USB
5. Dona Mensualmente Automaticamente
6. 100 Computadoras para la USB

Challenges:
- FlipCause doesn’t have an API available. The user would have to manually import a CSV file into the system. 
- Other payment platforms with APIs have larger fees.

Proposal:
- Build a WP plugin that captures where the user can import the data from FlipCause and it will display it on the leaderboard.
- Streamline the donation levels into maybe 3 or 4 so it’s easier to translate these into a ranking system for the leaderboard.

Questions to outline the scope of work:
Does the client want to have a general leaderboard or divide this by campaign?
Does the client have the human resources to manually import a CSV file on a daily/weekly basis into their system?
Is the leaderboard shown on the landing page or on each campaign, showing the ranking per campaign?
